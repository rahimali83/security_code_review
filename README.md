**SecureCode Guardian** is an intelligent and extensible code review agent for JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, WebStorm, etc.). It provides real-time and on-demand static analysis for security vulnerabilities, compliance violations, and code quality issues with a unique focus on **stateful remediation tracking** and a **dynamic, user-expandable rule engine**.

**developed as part of a learning project by integrating existing security check rulebase with Claude Code**

## üéØ Key Features

### üîí Comprehensive Security Analysis
- **OWASP Top 10 Detection**: SQL injection, XSS, command injection, and more
- **CWE Coverage**: Common Weakness Enumeration patterns
- **Cryptographic Failures**: Detect weak algorithms (MD5, SHA1, DES)
- **Secrets Detection**: Find hardcoded passwords, API keys, tokens
- **API Security**: Missing authentication, insecure HTTP, SSRF

### üìã Compliance Mapping
Built-in rules mapped to industry standards:
- **PCI DSS**: Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
- **SOC2**: Service Organization Control 2
- **OWASP**: Open Web Application Security Project
- **NIST**: National Institute of Standards and Technology
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation

### üìä Stateful Vulnerability Tracking
- **NEW**: Vulnerabilities found in current scan only
- **PERSISTENT**: Vulnerabilities found in both current and previous scans
- **CLOSED**: Vulnerabilities resolved since last scan
- Track remediation progress over time
- Unique fingerprinting prevents duplicate tracking

### üé® Dynamic Rule Engine
- **Built-in Rules**: 10+ comprehensive security rules
- **Custom Rules**: Add project-specific rules without recompiling
- **YAML-Based**: Simple, readable rule format
- **Hot Reload**: Custom rules loaded automatically from `.securecode/rules/`
- **Pattern Matching**: Regex-based detection (AST and taint analysis planned)

### üîß IDE Integration
- **Tool Window**: Dedicated panel for viewing results
- **Quick Actions**: Run scans via menu, toolbar, or keyboard shortcut (`Ctrl+Shift+S`)
- **Quick Fixes**: Automated suggestions for common issues
- **JSON Reports**: Comprehensive, machine-readable output
- **Real-time Feedback**: See results immediately after scan

### Built-in Rules

The plugin includes 10 comprehensive built-in rules:

| Rule ID | Name | Severity | Category | Description |
|---------|------|----------|----------|-------------|
| SEC-001 | Hardcoded Secrets Detection | Critical | Secrets | Detects passwords, API keys, tokens |
| SEC-002 | SQL Injection | Critical | Injection | String concatenation in SQL queries |
| SEC-003 | Weak Cryptography | High | Cryptography | MD5, SHA1, DES usage |
| SEC-004 | Empty Catch Blocks | Medium | Quality | Exception swallowing |
| SEC-005 | Insecure HTTP | High | API Security | HTTP instead of HTTPS |
| SEC-006 | Command Injection | Critical | Injection | OS command injection |
| SEC-007 | Path Traversal | High | Security | File path manipulation |
| SEC-008 | SSRF | High | Security | Server-side request forgery |
| SEC-009 | Insecure Deserialization | Critical | Security | Unsafe object deserialization |
| SEC-010 | Missing Authentication | High | Authentication | API endpoints without auth |

## üõ†Ô∏è Creating Custom Rules

### Basic Example

Create `.securecode/rules/my-rule.yaml` in your project:

```yaml
id: CUSTOM-001
name: Detect Unsafe API Usage
description: Detects use of deprecated unsafe API methods
severity: high
category: security

patterns:
  - type: regex
    pattern: 'UnsafeAPI\.(dangerousMethod|riskyCall)'
    fileTypes: ["java", "kt"]
    message: "Use of unsafe API method detected"

quickFix:
  type: suggest
  description: "Replace with SafeAPI equivalent methods"

enabled: true
custom: true
```

### Advanced Example with Compliance

```yaml
id: CUSTOM-002
name: PII in Logs
description: Detects logging of personally identifiable information
severity: high
category: data_security

compliance:
  - framework: gdpr
    control: "Art. 32"
    requirement: "Security of processing"
  - framework: pci_dss
    control: "3.4"
    requirement: "Protect stored cardholder data"

patterns:
  - type: regex
    pattern: 'log\.(info|debug)\([^)]*ssn[^)]*\)'
    fileTypes: ["java", "kt", "py", "js", "ts"]
    message: "Social Security Number being logged"
  - type: regex
    pattern: 'log\.(info|debug)\([^)]*creditCard[^)]*\)'
    fileTypes: ["java", "kt", "py", "js", "ts"]
    message: "Credit card information being logged"

quickFix:
  type: suggest
  description: "Remove PII from logs or implement data redaction"

enabled: true
```

See the [Custom Rule Creation Guide](docs/CUSTOM_RULES.md) for complete documentation.
